I have 3 div elements.

1st div is bigger (wrap) and has position:relative;

2nd div is positioned absolute to the 1st div relative positioning (and is included in the 1st div)

3rd div is contained in the 2nd div and also has absolute positioning.


"Because the 3rd div is absolute positioning to the absolute positioned 2nd div."

/**absolute: The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element**/

 I think you're confusing this a little. position:relative means that element will be positioned (using top, right, bottom left) relatively from its current position. position: absolute means it will be positioned relative to browsers window or first parent with position: absolute or position: relative.
